        <h1>About Exoplanets</h1>
        <p>An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet outside of our solar system that usually orbits another star in our galaxy.<br>
            Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe. We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.

            Although exoplanets are far – even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away – scientists have discovered creative ways to spot these seemingly tiny objects.

        <h1>How are Exoplanets found ?</h1>
        <p>There are five methods scientists commonly use to discover exoplanets.
            The two main techniques are the transit and radial velocity methods.
            When a planet passes directly between an observer and the star it orbits, it blocks some of that starlight. For a brief period of time, that star’s light actually gets dimmer. It's a tiny change, but it's enough to clue astronomers in to the presence of an exoplanet around a distant star. This is known as the transit method.
            Orbiting planets cause stars to wobble in space, changing the color of light astronomers see when observing a star. Stars are affected by the gravitational tug of their orbiting planets and, when observed through a telescope, this affects the star's light spectrum. If the star moves in the direction of the observer it will appear to be shifted toward blue. If it is moving away from the observer, it will shift toward the red. Observing this is known as the radial velocity method.

        <h1>Why is it important for us to study exoplanets?</h1>
        <p>Learning about exoplanets opens up a whole new frontier of discovery that challenges our understanding of the universe. These planets, orbiting stars beyond our solar system, offer a glimpse into the incredible diversity of planetary systems. By studying exoplanets, we can better understand the formation and evolution of our own solar system, and perhaps even the origins of life itself.
             The discovery of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of distant stars raises profound questions about the potential for life beyond Earth. Could there be other civilizations or forms of life evolving under different conditions? Exoplanet research also drives technological innovation, as new instruments and space missions are developed to detect and analyze these distant worlds. Moreover, learning about the atmospheric composition, weather patterns, and surface conditions of exoplanets could eventually guide us in finding planets that are potentially habitable, which could one day influence future exploration or colonization efforts. Isn't the pursuit of such knowledge, driven by our innate curiosity, essential to advancing human understanding and perhaps even securing the long-term survival of our species.
