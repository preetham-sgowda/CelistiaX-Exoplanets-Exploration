                <i>51 Pegasi b</i>, or <i>Dimidium</i>, is an extrasolar planet approximately 50 light-years (15 parsecs) away in the constellation Pegasus. It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a Sun-like star, 51 Pegasi, and marked a breakthrough in astronomical research.51 Pegasi is the Flamsteed designation of the host star. The planet was originally designated 51 Pegasi b by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who discovered the planet in 1995. The following year it was unofficially dubbed "Bellerophon" /bɛˈlɛrəfɒn/ by astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, who followed the convention of naming planets after Greek and Roman mythological figures (Bellerophon is a figure from Greek mythology who rode the winged horse Pegasus).

            <p>
                Kepler-6b is an extrasolar planet in the orbit of the unusually metal-rich Kepler-6, a star in the field of view of the NASA-operated Kepler spacecraft, which searches for planets that cross directly in front of, or transit, their host stars. It was the third planet to be discovered by Kepler. Kepler-6 orbits its host star every three days from a distance of .046 AU. Its proximity to Kepler-6 inflated the planet, about two-thirds the mass of Jupiter, to slightly larger than Jupiter's size and greatly heated its atmosphere.

Follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation, which was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010 along with four other Kepler-discovered planets.

            <p>
                Kepler-186f[2][3] (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-571.05) is an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Kepler-186,[4][5][6] the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope. It is located about 580 light-years (180 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.[7]

Kepler-186f orbits its star at a distance of about 0.43 AU (64,000,000 km; 40,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 130 days, and a mass and radius around 1.44 and 1.17 times that of Earth, respectively. As one of the more promising candidates for habitability, it was the first planet with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star. However, key components still need to be found to determine its habitability for life, including an atmosphere and its composition and if liquid water can exist on its surface.

            <p>
                55 Cancri e (abbreviated 55 Cnc e, also known as Janssen /ˈdʒænsən/) is an exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like host star, 55 Cancri A. The mass of the exoplanet is about eight Earth masses and its diameter is about twice that of the Earth.[3] 55 Cancri e was discovered on 30 August 2004, thus making it the first super-Earth discovered around a main sequence star, predating Gliese 876 d by a year. It is the innermost planet in its planetary system, taking less than 18 hours to complete an orbit. However, until the 2010 observations and recalculations, this planet had been thought to take about 2.8 days to orbit the star.[5]

                Due to its proximity to its star, 55 Cancri e is extremely hot, with temperatures on the day side exceeding 3,000 Kelvin.[6] The planet's thermal emission is observed to be variable, possibly as a result of volcanic activity.[7] It has been proposed that 55 Cancri e could be a carbon planet.[8]
                
                The atmosphere of 55 Cancri e has been extensively studied, with varying results. Initial studies suggested an atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium,[9] but later studies failed to confirm this, instead supporting an atmosphere composed of heavier molecules,[10] possibly only a thin atmosphere of vaporized rock.[11] Most recently as of 2024, JWST observations have ruled out the rock vapor atmosphere scenario and provided evidence for a substantial atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide.[12]

            </h1>
            <p>
                WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter[4] (a class of extrasolar planets) orbiting the star WASP-12, discovered in April of 2008, by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey.[5][1] The planet takes only a little over one Earth day to orbit its star, in contrast to about 365.25 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun. Its distance from the star (approximately 3.5 million kilometers [2.2 million miles; 0.023 astronomical units]) is only 
1
43
{\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {1}{43}}} the Earth's distance from the Sun, with an eccentricity the same as Jupiter's. Consequently, it has one of the lowest densities for exoplanets ("inflated" by the flux of energy from the star). On December 3, 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) reported detecting water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.[6][7] In July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars.[8]

In September 2017, researchers working on the HST announced that WASP-12b reflects just 6% of the light that shines on its surface. As a result, the exoplanet has been described as "black as asphalt" and as "pitch black."

            <h1>PSR B1257+12 C</h1>
            <p>
                PSR B1257+12 C, alternatively designated PSR B1257+12 d and also named Phobetor, is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting the pulsar Lich approximately 2,315 light-years (710 parsecs; 22 quadrillion kilometres) away from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. It was one of the first planets ever discovered outside the Solar System. It was discovered using the pulsar timing method, where the regular pulses of a pulsar are measured to determine if there is a planet causing variations in the data.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.[3] The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.[4] In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Phobetor for this planet.[5][6] The winning name was submitted by the Planetarium Südtirol Alto Adige in Karneid, Italy. Phobetor is, in Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep) who appears in dreams in the form of beasts.

            <h1>Gliese 12</h1>
            <p>
                The transiting exoplanet Gliese 12 b was discovered by TESS, and two independent studies confirming it as a planet were published in May 2024.[5][6] Gliese 12 b is similar in size to Earth and Venus, and completes an orbit around its star every 12.8 days. Its mass is poorly constrained but is known to be less than 4 times that of Earth.[5]

                Along with the planets of TRAPPIST-1 and LHS 1140 b, Gliese 12 b is one of the nearest known relatively temperate transiting exoplanets, and so is a promising target for the James Webb Space Telescope to determine whether it has retained an atmosphere.[7] Gliese 12 b orbits slightly closer than the inner edge of its star's habitable zone, with an insolation between those of Earth and Venus.[6] Its equilibrium temperature, assuming an albedo of zero, is 315 K (42 °C; 107 °F); if it has an atmosphere, the surface temperature would be greater than this.

It is located about 1,400 light-years (430 pc)[6] from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.

                Kepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 385 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.5 times that of Earth. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth[6] planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very Sun-like star.[7] However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy from its star than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.

                Tau Ceti e, also called 52 Ceti e, is an exoplanet candidate orbiting Tau Ceti, first detected in 2012 by statistical analyses of the star's variations in radial velocity obtained using HIRES, AAPS and HARPS. Its possible properties were refined in 2017, where it was one of two planets recovered from new data, the other being Tau Ceti f. It would orbit at a distance of 0.552 AU (between the orbits of Venus and Mercury in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses.If Tau Ceti e possesses an Earth-like atmosphere, the surface temperature would be around 68 °C (341 K; 154 °F). Based upon the incident flux upon the planet, a study by Güdel et al. (2014) speculated that the planet may lie inside the inner-boundary of the habitable zone and be a Venus-like world.

                Kepler-62f[1][2][4] (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.04) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope. It is located about 982 light-years (301 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.[5]

Kepler-62f orbits its parent star at a distance of 0.718 AU (107,400,000 km; 66,700,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 267 days, and has a radius of around 1.41 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun – thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or so.[6] Based on its size, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet. However, key components of the exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies within the outer part of its host star's habitable zone.
